# Hotpatching Embedded Real-time Applications
Implementation of Hotpatching-Embedded Real Time Application using Flash Patch and Breakpoint in ARM Cortex M4 controllers. 

## Environment Setup:

**Required Software:**
+ Git
+ Docker
+ Python
+ Stellaris ICDI Drivers
+ Uniflash

**Recommended Software:**
+ OpenOCD 
+ GDB-Debugger: GDB-Multiarch: ARM GNU Toolchain

**Hardware Setup:**

Arm Cortex-M4 based **TM4C123GH6PM Texas Instruments Tiva microcontroller** is used in this implementation. To prepare the hardware, load the bootloader present in `fpb_tools/bootloader` onto the evaluation board using **Uniflash**. UniFlash is a software tool for programming on-chip flash on TI microcontrollers and wireless connectivity devices and on-board flash for TI processors. UniFlash provides both graphical and command-line interfaces.
UNIFLASH is compatible with Windows, MacOS, and Linux. Download link: [https://www.ti.com/tool/UNIFLASH](https://www.ti.com/tool/UNIFLASH)

Setting up a Python virtual environment makes it easy to handle dependencies.
```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Install the `fpb_tools` in the virtual environment using
```
python3 -m pip install -e fpb-tools
```

**build.env**
```
python3 -m fpb_tools build.env --design <PATH_TO_DESIGN> --name <SYSTEM_NAME>
```
This builds a Docker image that will be used to create build and run environments for the system. Each subsequent step will be run in temporary containers, where all inputs are provided via read-only volumes, and outputs are stored on writable volumes

**build.build_firmware**
```
python3 -m fpb_tools build.build_firmware --design <PATH_TO_DESING> --name <SYSTEM_NAME> --folder <OUTPUT_VOLUME> --filename <BINARY_FILE_NAME>
```
This step builds the binaries that can be loaded into the development boards. The `fpb_tools` will invoke the design device Makefile in the `src/src_code` folder, which places the firmware binary and EEPROM contents in an output volume. This step also packages the firmware and EEPROM contents together so they can be loaded into the device.

**device.load_hw**

The load stage loads a packaged device binary+EEPROM into a target device. Plug a device with the bootloader installed into your computer, while hold down the `SW2` right button. The device will slowly flash a cyan LED, indicating it is ready to install firmware. Then start the device load step.
```
python3 -m fpb_tools device.load_hw --folder <OUTPUT_VOLUME> --filename <BINARY_FILE_NAME> --serial-port <SERIAL_PORT>
```
When the install finishes, the cyan LED will be solid. Now, power cycle the device, and the LED should be solid green, showing that the firmware is running.


## Patch Generation & Update

Primary focus of the implementation is to showcase a proof-of-concept for utilizing hardware-debugging units like Flash Patch & Breakpoint unit in ARM Cortex M3/M4 microcontrollers for hotpatching process. The implementation is deviated at a number of places from the original [paper](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/ndss2021_6B-2_24159_paper.pdf) like  the use of Flash memory to store the patch for persistent usage. `RTOS` has not been used in this example - hence strict real-time deadlines are not followed.

The implementation just switches on blue light `turn_blue_on()` and waits for a non zero time thrice. This iteration is performed forever.
```
void setup(){
    ....
}
void loop(){
    ....
    turn_blue_on()
    delay()
    turn_blue_on()
    delay()
    turn_blue_on()
    delay()
}
int main(){
    setup()
    while(True)
      loop()
}
```
Based on user's request, the device generates a patch and hotpatches one of the three `turn_blue_on()` functions to change the blue light to red, green or switch off completely without restarting the device. The firmware doesn't initially have the functionality to switch on red or green light or switch off all three completely.     

To hotpatch the device, run the following commands
```
python3 patch_update.py
```
Ensure that the device is connected to your system when the command is run. Currently any function can be hotpatched only once. To ensure this, the details of earlier hotpatching are stored in `patch_maintainer.json` file. If your firmware is updated thrice, then `patch_update` will prevent further updates. To go to the initial state, the firmware is to be uploaded again using `device.load_hw` and `patch_maintainer.json` file must be removed.

While running the patch update, ensure that there are no hardware breakpoints set by any debugger(Ex: OpenOCD GDB) - else the update will not be reflected, since the debugger also uses the same hardware as the hotpatching mechanism.
